PlantsVS.Zombies: Plants vs. Zombies is a classic tower defense game. I think we can make it 'infinite' and be like a rogue-like game(but having an end when enemy gets stronger enough). 
We can simply define enemy and our plants by using one simple function using parameters like 'HP, damage, moving speed, attack methode'.
